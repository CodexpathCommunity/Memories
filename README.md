# Memories
This is a fullstack crud applicaiton.
on the server I made a rest API using express and node.
I connected to a mongodb database cluster for our database.
on the client side we have react as the frontend framework.
also using dependencies like axiox, and custom useEffect hooks I could connect the frontend to the backend.
